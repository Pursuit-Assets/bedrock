 *   // In the render tree: {pending && <StageGateDialog .../>}
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - When `getStageGate(from, to)` returns null, fires the mutation
 *   directly and resolves on success.
 * - When a gate exists, returns a Promise that RESOLVES when the
 *   user confirms (and the stage update succeeds) and REJECTS when
 *   the user cancels / closes the dialog. The rejection lets the
 *   calling InlineSelect roll back its optimistic display so the
 *   cell shows the original stage again — otherwise the cell would
 *   look stuck on the new stage even though nothing was written.
 *
 * StageGateDialog calls `complete()` after a successful submit and
 * `dismiss()` on Cancel / Esc / backdrop click.
